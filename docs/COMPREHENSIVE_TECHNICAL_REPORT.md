## 2. Mathematical Formulation

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

The multi-agent tutorial system is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) where:

**State Space (S):** 
```
s_t = [p_t, h_t, e_t, d_t] ∈ ℝ^n
```
Where:
- p_t: Student performance vector at time t
- h_t: Question history representation
- e_t: Engagement metrics
- d_t: Difficulty progression indicators

**Action Space (A):**
```
A = A_DQN × A_PPO
A_DQN = {easy, medium, hard, adaptive}
A_PPO = {explanatory, practice, mixed}
```

**Reward Function:**
```
R(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) = α·R_performance + β·R_engagement + γ·R_efficiency
```

### 2.2 DQN Formulation

**Q-Learning Update:**
```
Q(s_t, a_t) ← Q(s_t, a_t) + α[r_t + γ max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a) - Q(s_t, a_t)]
```

**Neural Network Loss:**
```
L(θ) = 𝔼[(r + γ max_a' Q(s', a'; θ^-) - Q(s, a; θ))²]
```

**Experience Replay Buffer:**
```
D = {(s_i, a_i, r_i, s'_i)}_{i=1}^N
```

### 2.3 PPO Formulation

**Policy Gradient:**
```
∇_θ J(θ) = 𝔼[∇_θ log π_θ(a_t|s_t) A_t]
```

**PPO Clipped Objective:**
```
L^CLIP(θ) = 𝔼[min(r_t(θ)Â_t, clip(r_t(θ), 1-ε, 1+ε)Â_t)]
```

Where:
```
r_t(θ) = π_θ(a_t|s_t) / π_θ_old(a_t|s_t)
```

**Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE):**
```
Â_t = Σ_{l=0}^∞ (γλ)^l δ_{t+l}
δ_t = r_t + γV(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)
```

### 2.4 Multi-Agent Coordination

**Collaborative Coordination:**
```
J_total = J_DQN + J_PPO + λ·J_coordination
J_coordination = -||a_DQN - f(a_PPO)||²
```

**Competitive Coordination:**
```
J_DQN = 𝔼[R_DQN - α·R_PPO]
J_PPO = 𝔼[R_PPO - α·R_DQN]
```

**Hierarchical Coordination:**
```
a_PPO = π_PPO(s_t | a_DQN)
Q_DQN(s_t, a_DQN) = 𝔼[R_total | a_DQN, π_PPO]
```

    # Engagement component (30%)
    engagement_reward = normalize(time_spent) * interaction_quality
    
    # Learning efficiency component (20%)
    efficiency_reward = concept_mastery_gain / questions_attempted
    
    # Progression component (10%)
    progression_reward = difficulty_advancement_bonus
    
    return 0.4*performance_reward + 0.3*engagement_reward +
